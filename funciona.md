* I attempted to earn an “Exceeds Expectations” grade.
“Extra Credit” features I added:
- Add search component
- Add functionality to the search component
- Paginate search results
- Handle no results returned

* Description of my project:
When it comes to pagination it works as expected, a pagination is created based on the number of students. It has a search input that finds and displays only the wanted students and paginate them,
also add a message that appears when you do the search that tells you the number of students found, when no result matches the message  “NO RESULTS FOUND FOR: ” appears and when there is nothing written it returns to the normal form, all this in real time.

* Skills, techniques and process used to complete my project:
The pdf “List Pagination and Filtering Study Guide” It was very helpful, I did most of it following the instructions in the document, I also supported myself using Google to find out how to solve some errors
and Slack Overflow to solve my doubts.
