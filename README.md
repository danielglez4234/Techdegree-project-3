I attempted to earn an “Exceeds Expectations” grade. “Extra Credit” features I added:

T Shirt Section
Conditional Error Message (only on Email) 
Real-time Error Messages

* Display of the validation errors

- All of them except for the error of the 'Activities' section are displayed in Real Time
- The email input has two different errors
      .- when the format is not valid
      .- when the input is empty
- The activity section error is shown if the form is submitted and if at least one of the checkboxes has not yet been selected
- The payment section is only validated if it is selected
- The register button prevents sending if there is any error
